            Hello! Welcome to my page!
        </div>
        <p>
            I am a Worcester (Wooster) based web developer who specializes in back-end delivery of complex data sets.
            My passions outside of development include reading, travelling, and woodworking. Two of these interests are represented as games in the tabs above. I have an idea for what is almost certainly a massively over-ambitious woodworking page to add at some point But that probably won't happen any time soon, if at all (Did I mention I have a four year old?). For now, please enjoy my Map Game and my Stephen King reading list.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Map Game was a fun exercise in updating svg elements on the fly while writing to and reading from a database. Plans are in the works to eventually add a world map page, and maybe a compare to another user feature.

            Fright Club is a very scaled back version of what I originally hoped it would be. I wanted to directly call a public book API to search for any book by any author. There didn't seem to be an API of this kind though that would give reliably accurate result sets. I finally settled on getting all of Stephen King's books from the Open Library API, filtering the huge result set down by relevance, and importing the data I wanted into my own database. For the most part, I was able to do most of this programmatically, but I have to admit to manually culling the results due to a lack of reliable filtering options.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please take a look around and mess around with my games. Try to break them. This is still very much an un-QC-ed work-in-progress, so please let me know if you see any bugs. Er, I mean unintentional features.
        </p>
